### CPSC 120

* Lab 09

        Lab 09 Part-1 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of our first labs involving vectors. I struggle with vectors so it was extremely satisfying finishing part-1. It was also cool how you had to use a for loop in order to eliminate the greatest and smallest judge score.

* Lab 09

        Lab 09 Part-1 is another great lab because I had to use a boolean variable to check for conflicts in the two schedules. It was hard to figure out how to write the code to solve it but with help from the TAs it was possible. Overall, it was a fun challenge and a fun lab.

* Lab 10

        Lab 10 Part-1 was an interesting lab. I had to check a line of numbers to determine if they were prime numbers. One step involved reversing them and checking those for prime numbers. It was also our first time getting data from a source file, which was cool.
